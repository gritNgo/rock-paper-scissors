/**
 * function getComputerChoice()
 * interface: none
 * inputs: none
 * outputs: random output of rock/paper/scissors
 * steps to get output: 
 * 1. Create a variable randomizer to store a random number upto and excluding 3 (0/1/2)
 *      that will equate to rock/paper/scissors respectively
 * 2. Create a function that stores the output of the randomization  using math functions
 *      inside the computerSelection variable
 * 3. For now, test this on the console using console.log(function())
